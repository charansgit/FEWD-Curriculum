### Intro to JavaScript

JavaScript, not to be confused with Java, was created in 10 days in May 1995 by Brendan Eich, then working at Netscape and now of Mozilla. JavaScript was not always known as JavaScript: the original name was Mocha, a name chosen by Marc Andreessen, founder of Netscape. In September of 1995 the name was changed to LiveScript, then in December of the same year, upon receiving a trademark license from Sun, the name JavaScript was adopted. This was somewhat of a marketing move at the time, with Java being very popular around then.

### Variables in JS

A JavaScript application works with information. Variables are used to store this information. Since there can be different kinds(text, number, etc) of information, there exists different types of variables in JS.

#### What you must do?

- Read how to [convert variables from one type to another](https://javascript.info/type-conversions)
- Read about the [variable scope](http://javascriptissexy.com/javascript-variable-scope-and-hoisting-explained/)

#### Operators in JS

Information stored in variables often involves operations. Operators are symbols or keywords that tell the JavaScript engine to perform some sort of actions on the variables.
