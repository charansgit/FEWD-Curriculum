## Concept 1: HTML Basics

### Introduction
HTML is the markup that contains all the actual stuff that a web page has. All the text on this page you're reading right now lives inside HTML tags that tell your browser how to order the content on the page. Go on, right click any element on the page and choose "Inspect Element" to open up your browser's Developer Tools and it will show you the structure of the page.



### Learning Objectives
To consider yourself having learnt and applied HTML these are the basic questions you should have the answers to. If you don't have the answers to these questions, then revisit the material.

Must Know
* Why do we separate HTML and CSS?
* What are classes and IDs (and how are they different)?
* What are elements?
* What are tags?

### What you must do

- Do the [Codecademy HTML course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html) (only the free stuff) for a healthy baseline understanding of HTML.  Keep track of the most commonly used elements in HTML. [Estimated Time: 4hrs]

- Once you have gone through the above course, do this small assignment on CodePen. This assignment will take you 10 minutes to complete. If you are unable to do this assignment, then go back to the resource and revise your concepts. [Estimated Time: 30mins]. [CodePen Assignment](https://codepen.io/lambdaschool/pen/RyVowM/)

- Next have a look at all the different elements of HTML that make up your general webpage. The best reference is MDN documentation. Have a look [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element#Content_sectioning) [Estimated Time: 6hrs]

- Still have some questions on HTML. Refer to the first two lessons of [Shay Howe's HTML tutorial](https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/building-your-first-web-page/). [Estimated Time: 4 hrs]
